# 3D-Printing-Calculator-App

___

## In this app, the goal is to have a repository of 3D printers and 3D printing materials the user may edit, update, and remove as they desire and it would provide a summary of how much material and time is needed, how much one would charge for a commisioned project, and a pie chart breaking down the cost of:

- preparation
- material
- electricity
- consumables
- preparation
- depreciation.

## A draft of the concept can be found in the Excel spreadsheet included in the repository.
